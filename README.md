# Arcade Game

This is a simple arcade game to train reflexes.

## Instructions

If you want to play this game, just open the file **index.html** in any browser.

### How The Game Works

The gameplay rules are very simple: you need to get the most points using 3 lives.
Every time you get to the water you will receive 50 points. It will be not easy, because on the way you will encounter enemies (bugs) who kill. Collision with an enemy (bug) means losing one life and reducing the score by 10 points. So you must avoid them.


Above the board are: the current score and the number of lives.

The game ends when the player loses all life. The player receives a message with the result and possibility to play again.

## How to play?

The player moves the board with the arrow keys (left, right, up and down).
The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.
The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene

Warning: this game is drawn.
